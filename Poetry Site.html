<h1 style="text-align:center"> Storm </h1>
<h2 style="text-align:center"> By Emily Elizabeth Dickinson </h2>
<p style="text-align:center"> "It sounded as if the streets were running, <br/>
And then the streets stood still. <br/>
Eclipse was all we could see at the window, <br/>
And awe was all we could feel." </p>

<p style="text-align:center"> "By and by the boldest stole out of his covert, <br/>
To see if time was still there. <br/>
Nature was in her beryl apron, <br/>
Mixing fresher air." </p>
